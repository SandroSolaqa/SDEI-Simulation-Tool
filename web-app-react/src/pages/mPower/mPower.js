      <p>Storing energy remains costly, making the ability to squeeze value out
         of every kilowatt hour critically important. Here, is where mPower comes in,
         instead of limiting the use of stored energy to a small number of hard-wired
         essential circuits, mPower enables a home or business owner to easily employ 
         any solar-based stored energy across any current circuit. This device can be
         easily snapped into any existing circuit breaker panel and the smart architecture
         allows it to be tailored to any specific number of breakers. Allows users to 
        energy storage consumption efficiently and cost-effectively, delivers discretion over
        what circuits to use in any situation, unlocks energy storage performance, and dramatically
        improves its return on investment.
